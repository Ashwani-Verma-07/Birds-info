        <p class="info">The Finn's Weaver is a prime example of a species that is poorly known 
            and hence relatively neglected. Rediscovered in 1959, and restricted 
            to India and Nepal, it inhabits pure Terai (grassy floodplain) country 
            with marshes and tall, wet grasslands sparsely dotted with isolated 
            trees.</p>

        <p class="info"> Great Indian Bustard, Macqueen's 
            Bustard, suffered continuous population declines because of historical hunting and widespread habitat loss, compounded with their 
            slow growth and reproduction. These are classified 
            as Critically Endangered in the IUCN Red List 2019 and is in need of urgent conservation 
            action. </p></div>

        <p class="info">This laughingthrush endemic to the 
            Indo-Myanmar lowland forests is only 
            known within India from the Dehing 
            Patkai forests in eastern Assam. Conservation of these last remaining lowland rainforests in North-east India is 
            key to the survival of this species.</p></div>

        <p class="info">Severely threatened because of trapping for the pet trade in the past, this 
            central Indian endemic is now regularly 
            seen only in parts of the Aravallis and 
            the northern Eastern Ghats. Other 
            populations need to be urgently identified through surveys, and protected.</p></div>

        <p class="info">One of many range-restricted Wren 
            Babblers found in North-east India, 
            this cryptic species is endemic to the 
            Naga hills and adjoining Manipur. Only 
            known from a few locations, the species 
            may be threatened in most of its small 
            range due to habitat loss.</p></div>

        <p class="info">Restricted to grasslands in the Brahmaputra river floodplains, little is known 
            about this nondescript babbler that 
            looks rather like a prinia. Stretches of 
            river and associated grasslands preferred by this species are fast disappearing across its range.</p></div>
